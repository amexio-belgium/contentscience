	headline="70% of all content in your organization is unstructured. How can you maximize its value?"
	description="Today, managing the lifecycle of vast amounts of unstructured content poses a significant challenge for businesses. Without a standardized approach to content governance, efficiency issues arise, leading to time-consuming and costly processes. Content teams typically struggles with content that is siloed, unstructured, and difficult to access.<br /><br />At the same time, customers have a hard time finding the right information across your digital channels.<br /><br />The solution? Apply the power of a Large Language Model (LLM) and related technologies to your content, right? But how can you ensure customers get a qualitative experience, including accurate and up-to-date information? LLMs on their own fall short, since they often miss domain knowledge and come up with inaccurate information...<br /><br />That's where <strong>Content Science</strong> comes in.">

    headline="How can Content Science help?"
    description="Technologies like Generative AI are not a magic bullet: without a centralized content governance process, additional enrichment to content or context classification, the output of Generative AI models tends not to be suitable for high-end production use cases. The discipline of Content Science therefore focuses on harnessing unstructured content within your organization to its fullest potential by optimizing its lifecycle for AI use cases.">
