	headline="70% of all content in your organization is unstructured. How can you maximize its value?"
	description="Today, managing the lifecycle of vast amounts of unstructured content poses a significant challenge. Without a standardized approach to content governance, efficiency issues arise, leading to time-consuming and costly processes.<br /><br />At the same time, customers have a hard time finding the right information across your digital channels.<br /><br />The solution? Apply the power of a Large Language Model (LLM) and related technologies to your content, right? But how can you ensure customers get a <strong>qualitative</strong> experience, including <strong>accurate</strong> and <strong>up-to-date</strong> information? LLMs on their own fall short, since they often miss domain knowledge and come up with inaccurate information.<br /><br />That's where <strong>Content Science</strong> comes in.">

    headline="How can Content Science help?"
    description="Techniques like <strong>Retrieval Augmented Generation</strong> (RAG) are not a magic bullet: without a centralized content governance process, additional enrichment to content or context classification, the output of Generative AI models tends not to be suitable for high-end production use cases. The discipline of Content Science therefore focuses on harnessing unstructured content within your organization to its fullest potential by optimizing its lifecycle for AI use cases.">

	headline="Introducting Content Pipelines"
	description="Content teams typically struggles with content that is siloed, unstructured, and scattered across different sources. A Content Pipeline allows you to put the Content Science discipline into practice by <strong>transforming your raw content</strong> into structured, annotated, and accessible information, significantly enhancing the performance of applied AI models.<br /><br />A Content Pipeline <strong>complements your RAG</strong> setup by collecting and connecting diverse data sources, the pipeline begins by cleaning and filtering the content to remove noise and irrelevant information. Classification and annotation processes then organize the content into meaningful categories and add valuable metadata. Constructing a knowledge graph embeds these structured insights, creating rich, interconnected data representations.">

	<FaqQuestion
		headline="Is Content Science related to Data Science?"
		headlineTag="h3"> 
		<p>Content Science can indeed be seen as the counterpart of Data Science: Content Science focuses on the systematic organization, classification, and management of unstructured content to enforce higher-quality results in content retrieval scenarios using AI models. Data Science, on the hand, involves the extraction of insights from structured data through statistical analysis, machine learning, and other advanced analytical techniques. It is typically used for audience segmentation, content personalization and recommendations.</p>
