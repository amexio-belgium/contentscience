	<p>The only way to achieve tangible business outcomes, is to use a <strong>holistic</strong> approach that spans from user experience (UX) design and technical implementation all the way to strategic guidance and team enablement.</p>
	<p>Therefore, we implement our FusionCX approach in your project, in which we closely <strong>collaborate</strong> with key stakeholders at your organization (IT, business, author teams and marketing) to define clear business goals, streamline content processes, and cultivate a culture of continuous optimization and experimentation.</p>
	<p>To ensure proper rollout and user adoption, we provide thorough onboarding and training for your teams, sharing best practices to ensure <strong>sustained</strong> success and a deep understanding of the tools and strategies at their disposal.</p>

    <p>Successful CXM projects thrive on early and continuous feedback from business stakeholders and real end users. A traditional phased 'waterfall' approach, with its linear process of gathering requirements, designing, developing, and testing, is ill-suited for these projects. The risks associated with a waterfall process are significant: it can lead to extensive delays, unanticipated costs, and late discovery of critical issues, which may result in costly changes and ultimately deliver value only towards the end of the project.</p>
	<p>Therefore, we use Agile best-practices like DevOps and Test Automation in our FusionCX approach. This allows us to release early and often, facilitating a constant feedback loop. This enables us to gather real-world data, measure outcomes, and adapt our solutions to changing market trends, business requirements, and technological advancements.</p>
	<p>Launching a Minimum Marketable Product (MMP) early in the project lifecycle is central to this approach. It allows us to collect valuable data from actual users, which informs iterative improvements.</p>

<Faq headline="Questions we usually get">
	<FaqQuestion
		headline="How can we define our initial project scope?"
		headlineTag="h3"> 
		<p>The Product Owner (PO) plays a crucial role in maintaining the product vision by identifying the problems to solve and the target audience. The PO gathers and curates stakeholder ideas as user stories, determining what should be built and what should be deferred or excluded. These user stories are then organized into a product backlog, prioritized based on business value and cost. The product backlog is continuously evolving, reflecting new ideas or changes, and is built iteratively to ensure the project remains aligned with its goals.</p>
	</FaqQuestion>
	<FaqQuestion 
		headline="How can we estimate initial project budget?"
		headlineTag="h3" >
		<p>We calculate the cost of running a Scrum Team over a specified period. This involves determining the full-time equivalent (FTE) roles required, such as Business Consultants, Technical Leads, Developers, Testers, Architects, DevOps Engineers, and Project Managers. It is important to note that maintaining a stable Scrum Team is a core principle, as increasing team size does not linearly increase velocity due to the overhead involved. This careful estimation ensures that the project is adequately resourced while remaining cost-effective.</p>
	</FaqQuestion>
	<FaqQuestion 
		headline="How can we estimate the cost per user story?" >
		<p>Each story is assigned a value in Story Points using a technique called Planning Poker. Story Points help determine the amount of work that can be accomplished by the Scrum Team within a single sprint, which is referred to as the team's Velocity. Velocity is calculated as the total Story Points completed per sprint and is a key metric for forecasting future work. After each sprint, Velocity is measured, and the forecast is adjusted, becoming more accurate over time. This iterative estimation process helps ensure that project planning remains realistic and adaptable.</p>
	</FaqQuestion>
	<FaqQuestion 
		headline="How can we make sure project deadlines are met?">
		<p>It's crucial to recognize that, in an Agile approach, scope details are not fixed. By breaking down larger tasks into smaller, manageable pieces and frequently revisiting their estimates, teams can adapt to changes and ensure that the most critical elements are completed on time. Backlog Grooming plays a key role in this process, helping to prioritize tasks so that the maximum business value is delivered at any given moment, ensuring that deadlines are not just met, but that they also align with delivering the most impactful outcomes.</p>
	</FaqQuestion>
	<FaqQuestion 
		headline="How much time should we spent analysing up-front?">
		<p>To reduce risk and uncertainty in Agile projects, it's essential to build knowledge up-front through activities like technical analysis, prototyping, and feasibility studies. This early investment in understanding the project's landscape helps mitigate business, technical, and cost/schedule risks. However, decision-making should be deferred until it's absolutely necessary, allowing the project to adapt to new information as it becomes available. High-level architecture should be established early, with further refinements made during the sprints, ensuring that the project remains flexible and aligned with customer value throughout its lifecycle.</p>
