        <ContentText>
        <p>AmeXio was tapped to do the implementation of the platform with Adobe Experience Manager in close 
        collaboration with Internet Architects, which was responsible for the first steps of the project â€“ concept, 
        functional analysis and graphic design. Adobe Experience Manager is very suited for the tasks at hand, with 
        functionalities such as in-line editing and good asset management. Without a doubt one of the main challenges 
        of this project was the large amount of websites that needed to be rolled-out in a relatively short time. By 
        the time the project was finished, 18 websites needed to be built.
        The new websites were aimed at the general public, so there were extensive guidelines concerning responsiveness and 
        accessibility which needed to be followed. For example: according to Belgian government policies, the website needed to 
        adhere to Anysurfer guidelines. Some of the websites also required more than one language version, something which is easily 
        implementable in Adobe Experience Manager. This is the case, for example, for the Photography Museum website, which appeals to 
        tourists and offers information in English, French, German and of course Dutch.
        On top of that, it was important that sharing content between sites would be easy. If the Fashion Museum would add a news item 
        about an upcoming event, it should be possible to display the item on the main website of the Province, for instance. 
        AmeXio was also asked not only to build the platform and get 18 sites operational, but also to provide a toolkit so the 
        IT department of the Province itself could easily create further sites themselves in the future, if necessary. In the end the 
        platform would be used by about 80 different departments of the Province, all of which would be managing some pages on specific sites. 
        This highlights the complexity of underlying projects like this that on the surface seem simple, but can become complex because of the
        great amount of users and different usages.</p>
