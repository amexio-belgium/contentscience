            <p>AmeXio has launched the news portals for De Tijd and L'Echo, the Dutch and French news titles for Mediafin, the innovative media publisher from Belgium. Offering a multimedia approach to business, financial markets and political content, these media outlets reach the most influential and most affluent audience in Belgium, with over 300.000 readers every day: entrepreneurs, managers and investors, decision makers with considerable spending power.</p>
            <p>The two websites built on Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) were initially launched in public beta (“primeur”), meaning visitors could switch from the new to the old version and vice versa if desired.</p>

            <strong>There are also two important highlights on the content side.</strong>
            <p>First of all, all the editorial content is still managed in Mediafin’s legacy systems. The workflow is so specific to their business that it wouldn’t be efficient to change their core business system.</p>
            <p>This was also the reason why they chose Adobe: AEM allows content managers to shuffle the content around between the homepage and landing pages to make the whole presentation much more dynamic. Authors can also easily assemble news “dossier” packages related to a certain topic and create the dossier page “on-the-fly” in almost any layout they want, without any impact on the editorial teams.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the fact that the new websites are Mediafin’s sales channels and their product at the same time means they’re business critical. Needless to say that a lot of focus has been given to infrastructure and performance tuning.</p>
            <p>AmeXio's team of more than 15 digital experts will continue to work on developing new functionalities to improve readers’ experience as well as authoring experience for the content managers.</p>
