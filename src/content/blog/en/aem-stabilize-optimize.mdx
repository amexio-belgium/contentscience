    <p>Is your organization struggling to produce <strong>impactful customer experiences at scale</strong> using Adobe Experience Manager (AEM)? You’re certainly not alone.</p>
    <p>As you grow your digital presence, more and more internal teams start onboarding onto your Digital Experience Platform (DXP) and require additional customer journeys to be implemented and continuously improved upon. On initial launch, such platforms are usually very lean. However, as they expand over time, they become harder to govern and to keep healthy in the long run.</p>
</LayoutSection>
<LayoutSection>
    <p>When not managed properly, challenges tend to pop up in 3 key areas:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Cost & time to market:</strong> Solution complexity and developer friction increases, resulting in longer lead times and higher costs to go from idea to a stable solution in production.</li>
        <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> As additional features are implemented, usability and productivity for business users (authors and marketers) erodes due to an overload of new features and the addition of numerous quick fixes and workarounds.</li> 
        <li><strong>Customer Experience:</strong> Performance and stability issues cause your customers to suffer from a degraded digital experience.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In a highly volatile market, where customer needs and expectations are constantly evolving, an underperforming DXP can have a devastating <strong>impact on customer engagement and conversion rates</strong>. Web Content Management (WCM) tooling like AEM plays a vital role in this, being one of the core elements in an Enterprise DXP.</p>
    <p>Therefore, your AEM ecosystem should be in absolute <strong>pristine condition</strong> to enable high-quality experiences for your customers.</p>
    <h2>Web Content Management challenges at large Enterprises</h2>
    <p>Like with most digital platforms, WCM systems are usually rolled out across an organization in phases. As departments get onboarded, additional business processes are implemented and more digital channels are connected, things get more complex.</p>
    <p>Before looking into how you can manage this complexity, let’s first dive deeper into the struggles.</p>
    <p>Working with numerous Enterprise AEM clients for the past 15 years, we have identified several <strong>key challenges</strong> that one can expect when scaling an AEM-based ecosystem:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Additional teams of authors and marketers come onboard, with an increasingly diverse skillset and background, each having specific requirements and expectations for how the system can support them in their content production and publication needs. A once clean set of standards and best practices become polluted as new (variations of) components and templates are developed to adhere to these specific business requirements. Over time, this results in <strong>increased maintenance costs</strong> due to duplicated functionality and fragmentation of the codebase.</li>
        <li>Priority is shifted towards new feature development, with less or no attention to lower-level platform maintenance, resulting in <strong>technical debt</strong>. This shift can often be attributed to the organizational structure: an increased distance between developers and business results in a feature-driven approach, with more focus on outputs (e.g. stories delivered) instead of outcome (e.g. increased conversion rates).&nbsp;</li>
        <li>As team members switch roles or leave the team, <strong>knowledge sharing</strong> is neglected. This causes technical debt to build up further. When no attention is given to paying off this technical debt, new developments systematically come with extra costs ("interest" on the debt), resulting in increased development cost and time-to-market and a <strong>poor return-on-investment</strong> (ROI). Moreover, system upgrades induce more risk, while major changes (e.g. transition to cloud) are deferred.</li>
        <li>To speed up time-to-market, new developers are onboarded without proper training. This usually results in <strong>bad practices</strong> and anti-patterns slipping into the codebase.</li>
        <li>At the same time, business users look for alternative systems to build and deliver the required digital experiences at a more rapid pace or to address a broader market. This results in the emergence of <strong>"shadow IT"</strong> as well as content silos, which give birth to <strong>inconsistencies</strong> in content, design and UX.</li>
        <li>Over time, structural issues pop up, impacting <strong>performance and stability</strong> for end-customers (front-end) and web authors (back-end). Worst case, your systems experience reduced <strong>availability</strong> due to unexpected downtimes.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These challenges block your organization from operating AEM efficiently and in the end prevent you to deliver <strong>a continuous stream of valuable services</strong> to your customers.</p>
    <p>At AmeXio, we have detected these symptoms at numerous clients over the past decade. Therefore, we have designed a bite-sized approach to help organizations recover from these pain points and stabilize their AEM-based ecosystem. Our AEM Stabilize & Optimize service is based on a proven methodology applied successfully at multiple of our Enterprise clients.</p>
    <h2>What is AEM Stabilize & Optimize?</h2>
    <p><strong>AEM Stabilize &amp; Optimize</strong> is a specialized offering tailored at large Enterprises using AEM as the center of their DXP. It is aimed to address the typical pain points listed above and to dramatically improve the ability to manage and deliver high-impact digital experiences. Our goal with this offering is clear: to <strong>stabilize, professionalize &amp; support your AEM-based ecosystem</strong></p>
    <p>In practice, it consists of an incremental, <strong>3-stage approach:</strong></p>
